CLASSIFYING CHEMICAL   REACTIONS
Chemical reactions can be classified in two ways; according to the way the reactant particles behave   in   relation to each other or according to changes that occur to the reacting particles.
If   we   focus   on   the   number   and   nature   of   the   reactants   and   products   and   on   the   type   of   transformation needed to convert the reactant(s) into the product(s), reactions can be classified as:
•             Combination (Synthesis) -   elements   or   less   complex   compounds   come   together to   form   a   single more   complex compound
•          Decomposition   -   a   compound breaks   apart   into   either   elements   or   less   complex   compounds
•          Displacement   -   a   single   element   replaces   another   one   in   a   compound
•          Exchange –   ions   from   one   compound   switch places with   ions   from   another   compound   to   form   two new compounds
Examples   of   different   types   of   reactions
Decomposition
•                This   is   the   simplest   type   of   reaction.
•                A single compound is broken   down   into   several   different   compounds.
Example 1:    When green crystals of   copper(II)   carbonate   are   heated,   a   gas   (which   can be   identified   as   carbon   dioxide) is released and black copper(II) oxide is   left as   a residue.
i.e.                                     CuCO3(s)    →      CuO(s)    +      CO2(g)
Since one reactant has visibly become two products, decomposition must have occurred.
Combination
•                This   is   the   opposite   of   decomposition
•                It   involves   the   joining   of   two   or   more   elements   or   compounds   to   form   a   single   compound.
Example: Hydrogen and chlorine react to produce hydrogen chloride   H2(g)    +    Cl2(g)    →      2HCl(g)
In a combination reaction, there will be several reactants but only   one product.
Displacement Reactions
•                In a displacement reaction, one   element   is   displaced   from   a   compound by   another   element in   its   elemental form.
•                The equation describing the reaction must have   an   element   and   a   compound   as reactants   and   a   different   element and compound as products.
Example: If   zinc metal is placed in a solution of   copper(II)   sulfate, the blue   solution   is decolourised. Colourless zinc sulfate is formed and copper metal forms   a brown   deposit.
Zn(s)    +    CuSO4(aq)          →          Cu(s)      +      ZnSO4    (aq)
Exchange Reactions
•                         An exchange reaction is one in which atoms or   groups   of   atoms   are   interchanged between   two compounds.
•                         For ionic compounds, an exchange reaction can be identified when two reactants   give two products by a   change   ofpartners   between   the   anions   and   cations.Example:             When   solutions   of   barium   chloride   and   sodium   sulfate   are   mixed,   a   precipitate   of   barium   sulfate
is formed and sodium   chloride is   left   in   solution.
BaCl2(aq)    +    Na2SO4(aq)    →    BaSO4(s)    +    2NaCl(aq)         Written   as   an   ionic   equation:    Ba2+(aq)    +      SO42-(aq) →    BaSO4(s)

Exercise 5.1
Identify   the   type   of   reaction   shown   in   each   of   the   following   chemical   equations. Justify   your   answers.
(a)                        2KClO3(s)    →             2KCl(s) + 3O2(g)
(b)                      AgNO3(aq) + KCl(aq)   →    AgCl(s) +   KNO3(aq)
(c)                        2H2(g) + O2(g)    →         2   H2O(g)
(d)                      2AgNO3(aq) +   Cu(s)      →      Cu(NO3)2(aq) +   2Ag(s)
(e)                        CaCO3(s)       → CaO(s)       +   CO2(g)
(f)                         2NaI(aq) + Cl2(g)    →       2NaCl(aq)         +   I2(s)
Ionic   Equations and Spectator Ions
When ionic compounds are dissolved in water, the   anions and   cations   dissociate   and   so   essentially   exist   independently. For example, when solid sodium chloride, NaCl(s), is   dissolved in water we   can write:

This implies that the ions have separated and dispersed through the   solution   so they will be   surrounded by water molecules. A solution of   sodium chloride is usually written as NaCl(aq) which is misleading   as   it   does   not show the separated ions. However, recognising the dissociation of   ions   can   simplify the way   equations for some reactions are written.
For example: For the reaction of   sodium chloride and silver nitrate   solutions
NaCl(aq)    +    AgNO3(aq)    →    AgCl(s)    +    NaNO3(aq)
We can consider the dissociation of   the salts in   solution   and write   the   equation   as:
Na+(aq)    +       Cl-(aq)    +    Ag+(aq)    +    NO3-(aq)    →    AgCl(s)    +    Na+(aq)       +    NO3-(aq)
Since nothing has happened to the Na+   and NO3-   ions during the reaction they are known as spectator   ions so   they can be eliminated from the   equation   as   follows:
Ag+(aq)    +    Cl-(aq)       →    AgCl(s)
This is known as a net ionic equation, or more   often,   an   ionic   equation.   (Note   that   the   formation   of   solid
AgCl implies a new compound as the ions have “changed partners”   from those   in the   original   solutions   and   the   formation   of   the   solid   removes   the   ions   from   the   solution).
Activity 5.2 –   ionic equations
This activity is designed to help you understand ionic equations

DISSOLVING
Dissolving a solute in a solvent   to make   a   solution   is   a physical process. A   solution   is   a mixture   and the   properties of   the components are retained. For example, when salt is   added to   water   the   solution tastes   salty            in the same way as do the salt crystals.   Since many   chemical reactions   occur   in   aqueous   solutions,   it   is useful   to understand the interactions between the particles in a solution.

•             For   aqueous   solutions, the   activity   of   the   water   solvent   is   related   to   the   nature   of the water molecules.
•             The water molecule, H2O, is bent with   the   H-O-H   angle being   about   105o.   The   O-H bond   is polar      because the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atom and   attracts   the   electron   density   in   the   bond   towards   itself.
•             As a result, the water molecule has   a negative   “end”   at the   oxygen   atom,   and positive   “ends”   at the
hydrogen atoms.    (In the diagram the δ symbol means ‘slightly’ – showing   that   the   ends   are   only
slightly positive and slightly negative). The shape of   the water molecule is   important   in   determining   its   solvent properties.
•                Substances dissolve in   one   another because the   solution   they   form   together   is more   stable   than   if   the   two   substances exist   separately.
•                This implies that the attractive   forces   between the   solvent   molecules   and the   solute   particles   (which   can   be molecules or ions) are greater than the attractive forces   within the   solute   structure   and the   attractive         forces between the solvent molecules.
•                Ionic solids n代 写CHEM 191 MODULE 5 CHEMICAL REACTIONS: PRECIPITATION and OXIDATION - REDUCTIONC/C++
代做程序编程语言ormally have strong   attractive   forces between   their   oppositely   charged   ions   so   for water to   dissolve an ionic substance the water molecules must have some way   of   overcoming these   attractive forces within the solid.
•                The   polar   nature   of   the   water   molecule   enables   it   to   reduce   the   attraction   between   the   charged   ions
because the negatively charged oxygen atoms in the water molecule interact with the positive   ions   in   the   ionic solid and the positively charged hydrogen atoms in the water molecule interact with the   negative ions.

Fig 5.1 Dissolving sodium chloride in water. Note the orientation of   the water molecules   around the   ions
•       Solvents that are composed of   polar molecules are   able to   dissolve both   ionic   and polar   substances but those with non-polar molecules cannot do so because they cannot overcome the attractive   forces
between the ions. In contrast non-polar solvents are more   able to   dissolve non-polar   solutes.
•      Non-polar solutes generally have weak intermolecular interactions in the solid or   liquid   and   they   interact   weakly with the solvent. If   their interactions with solvent molecules is similar to   or   stronger   than their
interactions   with   each   other   in   the   solid   state, then   the   solute   molecules   maybe   soluble.
•       Thus a general rule emerges - like dissolves   like.      That   is, polar   solvents   are more   likely   to   dissolve   ionic and polar solutes, and non-polar solvents are more likely to   dissolve non-polar   solutes.
Focussing Questions   1:


1.          How would you know   that   a   chemical   reaction has taken place?

3.          Explain, in   terms   of   energy, why   some   substances   dissolve   in water.
4.          What needs   to   happen   for   an   ionic   solid   to   dissolve   in water?
5.            To what does the rule “like dissolves like” refer?
6.          Why   are two   layers   observed   when   oil   and   water   are mixed?
   
PRECIPITATION   REACTIONS
Recall that when ionic solids dissolve in water they completely dissociate   (see   fig.5.   1) – that   is   the   ions   remain separated from each other   in   solution.
NaCl(aq)    →       Na+(aq)    +    Cl-(aq)
So an aqueous solution of   sodium chloride, NaCl(aq), contains the   ions Na+    and Cl–   surrounded by water   molecules.
Not all ionic solids (salts) are   soluble in   water, but   even   insoluble   salts   will   dissolve   to   a   very   small   extent.
Solubility rules can be used to determine whether a salt will   dissolve   or not.   (In this   context   insoluble means   that very little will dissolve and soluble means that a   reasonable   amount will   dissolve).   The   rules   are based on   observations   of   salts   of   common   cations   and   anions.
Solubility Rules
1. All salts of the Group 1 metals and of the ammonium ion, NH4+are soluble.
2. All nitrates, chlorates and ethanoates are soluble.
3. All chlorides, bromides and iodides are soluble except those of Ag+, Hg22+, Cu+and Pb2+.
4. All sulfates are soluble except those of Ca2+, Ba2+ and Pb2+.
5. All hydroxides, carbonates and sulfides are insoluble (except when Rule 1 applies).
Mixing two ionic solution sometimes results in the formation of   a   solid known   as   a   precipitate.   The solubility rules can be used to help identify a precipitate.
For   example:    A   mixture   of   silver   nitrate   solution, AgNO3(aq),,and   sodium   chloride   solution, NaCl(aq), results in a precipitate.
•             The   ions   present   on   mixing   will   be   Ag+, Na+, NO3-    and   Cl-   .
•             The   two   new   combinations   of   ions   in   the   mixture   are   AgCl   and   NaNO3.
•             Using the solubility rules, we can   see that the   only   combination that   will   give   an   insoluble   salt   is   AgCl.
•             Rule   1 says that all   salts   of   group   1 metals   are   soluble   so NaNO3    is   a   soluble   salt. Rule   3   lists the   chlorides   of   Ag+    as   being   insoluble.
The equation for the reaction:       NaCl(aq)    +    AgNO3(aq)    →    AgCl(s)    +    NaNO3(aq)
This can be written as an ionic equation: Ag+(aq)    +      Cl-(aq)      →    AgCl(s)

OXIDATION AND   REDUCTION   REACTIONS
Antioxidants
The term antioxidant will be a familiar term for you from the advertising of such things as ‘superfoods’ and anti-wrinkle creams. Antioxidants in biological systems are substances which may prevent some types of cell damage. Oxidation reactions in cells produce free radicals (molecules with an unpaired electron) that can damage or kill cells. Antioxidants stop oxidation reactions from occurring. Some commonly recognised antioxidants in biological systems include the Vitamins A, C and E.
Oxidation   - reduction   reactions, commonly   known   as   redox   reactions, are   classified   according   to   the changes that take place in the reacting particles. They can be described at particle level   as   electron transfer   reactions – one species loses electrons which are gained   by   another   species.Examples of   redox reactions include the rusting of   iron (iron metal (Fe)   is   oxidised to   form. rust,   a   compound containing   Fe3+   ions), the   burning   of   coal   or   wood   (carbon,or   carbon   containing   compounds   are   converted   to CO2) or the action of   a household bleach. In biological systems, respiration   and photosynthesis   are processes that involve oxidation-reduction reactions.
Definitions
If, in a chemical reaction, a species (atom,   ion   or molecule)   loses   electrons,   it   is   said to be   oxidised.   This term originally meant ‘reacted with oxygen’ as atoms of   all   elements   (except   fluorine)   lose   electrons when they react with the very electronegative oxygen atom. The electrons cannot be lost   completely, they   have   to   go somewhere, and the species that gains the electrons   is   said to be   reduced.   Oxidation   of   one   species cannot   happen   without   the   corresponding   reduction   of   another   species.
To   help   you   remember   you   can   use   one   of   the   following   mnemonics:
• Oxidation Is Loss of electrons Reduction Is Gain of electrons        (OIL RIG)
• Loss of Electrons is Oxidation Gain of Electrons is Reduction        (LEO GER)
In the reaction, the species that is oxidised (loses   electrons)   causes   another   species to be reduced   (by      providing it with electrons). Hence the oxidised species is known   as   a   reducing   agent   or   reductant.
Similarly, the reduced species removes electrons from another species   causing   it to be   oxidised.   Hence the   reduced species is known as an   oxidising agent   or   oxidant.
Representing Oxidation-Reduction   Reactions
Consider the reaction of   magnesium with oxygen.    2Mg(s)       +       O2(g)          →            2MgO(s)
The product, magnesium oxide, is an ionic compound made up of   Mg2+    and O2-    ions. We can   consider   each reactant separately:
Mg atoms lose electrons to become Mg2+    ions:             Mg          →          Mg2+             +       2e–
O atoms gain electrons to become O2-    ions:                            O2                +       4e-                   →          2O2–
During the reaction, electrons are transferred from Mg atoms to O atoms.
When considered separately these   steps are known as half reactions represented by   half equations.
The   half   reaction   equations   explicitly   show   the   number   of   electrons   involved   in   the   process. When   the   same number   of   electrons   are   involved   in   each   half   reaction   then   the   sum   of   the   two   half-reactions   (above)   gives       the overall reaction.
2Mg       +       O2             +       4e-                   →          2Mg2+             +       2O2-             +       4e-Cancelling the electrons on both sides of   the equation   and combining the   ions   as   MgO(s)   gives   the   equation,
2Mg(s)       +       O2(g)            →         2MgO(s)
In this reaction, magnesium is oxidised (loses electrons) and is a   reducing   agent   or   reductant because   it   causes the oxygen to be reduced. Oxygen is reduced (gains electrons), and   is   an   oxidising   agent   or   oxidant   because it causes the magnesium to be oxidised.
   
Example: When zinc metal is added to hydrochloric acid, bubbles of   hydrogen gas   are produced   and the   zinc metal eventually all   disappears.
Zn(s)       +       2HCl(aq)          →         ZnCl2(aq)       +       H2(g)
In this reaction the zinc is oxidised (its atoms lose electrons) to Zn2+(aq)   and the   H+(aq)   of   the   acid   is   reduced (the   ions   accept   electrons) and   it   becomes   molecular   hydrogen. Zinc   is   thereductant,   and   H+    is   the   oxidant,
To identify the redox processes (as shown in the half   equations) it is helpful to   first,   consider the   species   present in the reactants and products:   Since we have ZnCl2(aq) and HCl(aq) we can write:
Zn(s)       +       2H+(aq)       +       2Cl-(aq)          →          Zn2+(aq)       +       2Cl-(aq)       +       H2(g)
The chloride ion, remains unchanged - it is a   spectator ion   and   can therefore be   omitted   from the   equation:
Zn(s)       +       2H+(aq)          →         Zn2+(aq)       +       H2(g)So the half   reactions can be identified as:   Oxidation:                   Zn      →    Zn2+            +       2e-   Reduction:                     2H+       +         2e-      →         H2
Adding   these   half   equations   and   cancelling   out   the   electrons   gives:
Zn(s)       +       2H+(aq)          →         Zn2+(aq)       +       H2(g)
